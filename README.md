# RockLib.Compression

This library simplifies the usage of standard compression algorithms, as the standard compression API from .NET is a bit tricky to get right. There two interfaces are , `ICompressor` and `IDecompressor`, two implementations of each interface (GZip and Deflate), along with extension methods for the interface.

 ## ICompressor

 The `ICompressor` interface itself has a `Compress` method that takes a `Stream` parameter containing data and returns a `byte[]` containing the compressed stream.

 The first `ICompressor.Compress` extension method takes a `byte[]` and returns a `byte[]` containing the compressed input array.

 The second `ICompressor.Compress` extension method takes a `string` parameter and an optional `Encoding` parameter. It encodes the `string` into a `byte[]` and returns that array, compressed.

 ## IDecompressor

 The `IDecompressor` interface has a `Decompress` method that takes a `Stream` parameter containing compressed data and returns a `byte[]` with the decompressed stream.

 The `IDecompressor.Decompress` extension method takes a `byte[]` containing compressed data and returns a `byte[]` with the decompressed input array.

 ## Supported Targets

 This library supports the following targets:
   - .NET 6
   - .NET Core 3.1
   - .NET Framework 4.8

 ## Example

 ```csharp
 ICompressor compressor = new GZipCompressor();
 IDecompressor decompressor = new GZipDecompressor();

 byte[] compressed = compressor.Compress("Hello, world!");

 byte[] decompressed = decompressor.Decompress(compressed);

 string originalString = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decompressed);
 ```
